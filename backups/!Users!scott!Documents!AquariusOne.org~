"So does everyone walk around with a staff that can fire off lasers?  Seems dangerous."  She asked.
"No, children are given shards alone.  In the Hedge most carry the shard on their person, around their neck or in alaborate jewelry personalized to the person.  Shard fashion exists in some circles, that's for sure." He replied.
"Are you military then?"
"No, I built the staff as I worked my way out of the Hedge."  He continued, "The Hedge is a labrynth, it's complexity increases as you go further from the center of the city-state and then decreases again.  This keeps wildlife out and ensures that any citizens are capable enough to survive outside the hedge, as it takes a considerable amount of puzzlework and physical fitness to manage the Hedge labrynth.  One has to train with one's Ego, building up levels of abstraction and sensitivity to the environment before one can even sense that there is a pattern and a path out.

The druid pulled the hood of his cloak down over his eyes, shading his face from the harsh sun.  He  planted his staff in the sand, and pulled a thin wand from deep within the sleeve.  He began to speak in a low tones, stoccato commends punctuating his wand movements.  Patterns began to glow beneath the edge of his hood, it's light refleting off the druids pupils, dancing across his face.

"That's it, that should do well." He said finally, stashing the wand back deep within his sleeve, pulled back the hood and then grabbing the smooth surface of the his staff and began to slowly pulll it out of the pile of sand.  As he did so a shape began to form as light danced out of the end of the staff and the sand sintered into the shape fo a deep bowl.  After each pass of staff the druids foot would swipe over and erase the marks by covering them with a new layer of sand.  Soon his dance was over and he stood panting from the effort.

"Well, lets see what we've accomplished" He said to himself, and reached into the pile of sand before him.  With some effort he managed to pull a shape out of the sand.  An opaque mottled pear shape with a handle on one side and a lip on the opposite presented itself as loose bits of sand cascaded off.  With his hand wrapped underneath the bottom and the other on the handle he tipped the pitcher over and poured out the contents.  Trapped sand cascaded out and rejoined the beach below.  

He set the pitcher on the pile of sand and slowly walked a circle around it's paremeter, pointing his staff as he did so.  Light danced upon it's surface.  The rough texture glowed and smoothed into a smooth glassy finish with minute swirls of mutted tones slowly resolving themselves as the surface glow receaded.  He made three passes in total, the last of which the whole surface glowed evenly and receaded slowly as one.  He then pulled off a section of his cloak that seperated only at the last second as he wispered a low command.  This he wrapped around the pitcher and then with another command the cloth appeared to meld to itself and swell slightly as if to wrap its contents in an insolating cloud.

With a satisfied sigh, he sad down, pulled off his boots, pulled his hands into his sleeves and lifted the whole of his cloak off over his head.  He then placed the cloar over his staff which was still firmly planted in the bank.

"Recharge time"  He said outloud.  The cloak turned the deapest black, none of the ample sun reflected off it's surface.  He then turned, took a few steps into the water and dove into a deep pool where the currents eddy had cleared itself of the trapped sandbar.

* Plot
** Explain Aquarius One society

We ran away from the underwater city of Aquarius One because we were in love. We decided to escape because it was our only choice to be together. 

Let me back up, the year is 2177 and Aquarius One is an underwater city-state.  Due to limited resources the city is run by a massive artificial intelligence that determines much of the activities of the inhabitants, from their occupations to with whom they will cohabitate and reproduce.  Each individual's genetic make up is mapped out and analized to determine how best they fit within the society of the underwater community.  Each successive generation is planned out for optimal genetic health and productivity.  What was once left up to chance is now under the influence of science and the data crunching power of the Aquarius One servers.

Our love was outside of the plans of the central intelligence and was taboo within our society.



** Escape to the surface
*** city is at the bottom of a deep fjord, escape in a robotic shuttle that the two work on as coworkers.
*** using blockchain diagnostics, figure out that submersable robots are heading to the surface and that the air is breathable and temperatures are livable.


**  Meet techno druid 
*** dark green cloak that absorbs light and powers staff
*** staff is advanced computer that interact through voice, communicates to other druids, produces fire, lasers, electrical arcs or what not, ie technology so advanced that it appears to be magic
*** druid roams the land interacting with the natural world that has been left to take over once more.

Hedge, The Labrynthin City
-Fractal labryth with more complexity towards the edge, used to keep animals out of the city, and young in. 
-To explore one has to train one's Agent to solve and track the complexities of the maze.
-Known as the Hedge, because it's build out of intricate hedge rows that are harvested for food, lumber, herbs and medicine.  pheasants, rabbits, turtles and other partially domesticated animals live in the hedge.  Wilder animals are mostly kept out.

** Fractal antannae passively harvesting energy and information on a variety of wavelenghts, optical, radio, thermal, etc.  All wavelenths can be consummed, upconverted and processed by neural lattice pathways.  Lattice pathways
** Femptosecond laser ablation coupled with the ability to sense chemicals, and the wavelengths that are given off when the atoms are freed from their bounds.
** Ability to create Halbach Arrays on demand to effect magnetic fields.  This allows the bending of light, particle beams and connecting magnetic objects together.  Domain manipulation. 
** Syntropic programming and AR.  Used to describe the desired behavior and let the AI determine how best to compile this behavior.  Syntropic AR allows a visual of what something will grow to be.
